-do not download tomcat tarball repeatedly
-add CATALINA_HOME to /etc/environment (optional)
-check how /etc/init.d/tomcat6 affects catalina.policy
 it assumes we installed tomcat6 from packages which we did not.
 so mismatch in paths when installing from tarball
-add examples/comments on howto use the module
 especially regarding the tomcat_users array/hash structure
